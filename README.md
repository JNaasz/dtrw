Recreating a Wix site I made for a local running group that I'm part of. 
Plan is to progress this as I get more familiar with React.



To Do:
Get Google Calendar api set up with project to pull in upcoming events
Get a mapping api for route maps? May just use the link for this - currently have static route maps
Set up contact page with email sent to Ken
Brush up on graphql and set up db to store site info
Get set up with AWS for hosting
Admin page to update the content
