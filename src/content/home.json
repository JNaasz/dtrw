    "body": "The Downtown Runners and Walkers are an informal group of runners and walkers that enjoy running/walking and love the city of Detroit. Each Tuesday - rain or shine - 20 to 40 people ranging in abilities from seasoned marathoners to beginning walkers meet at a different metro Detroit restaurant or bar. After a quick introduction with route instructions, people take off on a course of four to six miles. The run/walk starts at 6:00 pm and afterwards everyone meets for food, drink and the most interesting conversations.",
